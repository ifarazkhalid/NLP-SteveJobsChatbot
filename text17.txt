history       alternative title  steven paul jobs   before article  steve jobs   in full  steven paul jobs     born february 24  1955   san francisco    california   u s  xe2 x80 x94died october 5  2011   palo alto   california   cofounder of apple computer  inc   now  apple inc     and a  charismatic  pioneer of the personal computer era   p1   founding of apple  jobs was raised by adoptive parents in cupertino  california  located in what is now known as  silicon valley   though he was interested in engineering  his passions of youth varied  he dropped out of  reed college   in  portland    oregon   took a job at atari corporation as a  video game  designer in early 1974  and saved enough money for a pilgrimage to  india  to experience  buddhism    p2   back in silicon valley in the autumn of 1974  jobs reconnected with  stephen wozniak   a former  high school  friend who was working for the  hewlett packard company   when wozniak told jobs of his progress in designing his own computer logic board  jobs suggested that they go into business together  which they did after hewlett packard formally turned down wozniak xe2 x80 x99s design in 1976  the  apple i   as they called the logic board  was built in the jobses xe2 x80 x99 family garage with money they obtained by selling jobs xe2 x80 x99s volkswagen minibus and wozniak xe2 x80 x99s programmable calculator   p3  the apple isteven jobs  right  and stephen wozniak holding an apple i circuit board   c   1976  courtesy of apple computer  inc   ml3   jobs was one of the first  entrepreneurs  to understand that the  personal computer  would appeal to a broad audience  at least if it did not appear to belong in a  junior high school  science fair  with jobs xe2 x80 x99s encouragement  wozniak designed an improved model  the  apple ii   complete with a keyboard  and they arranged to have a sleek  molded plastic case manufactured to enclose the unit   p4   though jobs had long  unkempt hair and  eschewed  business garb  he managed to obtain financing  distribution  and publicity for the company  apple computer  incorporated in 1977 xe2 x80 x94the same year that the apple ii was completed  the machine was an immediate success  becoming synonymous with the boom in personal computers  in the company had a record setting public stock offering  and in it made the quickest entrance  to that time  into the  fortune  list of america xe2 x80 x99s top companies  in the company recruited pepsico  inc   president  john sculley  to be its chief executive officer  ceo  and  implicitly  jobs xe2 x80 x99s mentor in the fine points of running a large corporation  jobs had convinced sculley to accept the position by challenging him   xe2 x80 x9cdo you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life  xe2 x80 x9d the line was shrewdly effective  but it also revealed jobs xe2 x80 x99s own near messianic belief in the computer revolution   p5  steve jobs with an apple ii computer  1977  ap  ml5    h3  insanely great  during that same period  jobs was heading the most important project in the company xe2 x80 x99s history  in he led a small group of apple engineers to a technology demonstration at the  xerox corporation  xe2 x80 x99s palo alto research center   parc   to see how the  graphical user interface  could make computers easier to use and more efficient  soon afterward  jobs left the engineering team that was designing lisa  a business computer  to head a smaller group building a lower cost computer  both computers were redesigned to exploit and refine the parc ideas  but jobs was explicit in favouring the  macintosh   or mac  as the new computer became known  jobs coddled his engineers and referred to them as artists  but his style was uncompromising  at one point he demanded a redesign of an internal circuit board simply because he considered it unattractive  he would later be renowned for his insistence that the macintosh be not merely great but  xe2 x80 x9cinsanely great  xe2 x80 x9d in january jobs himself introduced the macintosh in a brilliantly choreographed demonstration that was the centrepiece of an extraordinary publicity campaign  it would later be pointed to as the  archetype  of  xe2 x80 x9c event marketing  xe2 x80 x9d  p6   however  the first macs were underpowered and expensive  and they had few software applications xe2 x80 x94all of which resulted in disappointing sales  apple steadily improved the machine  so that it eventually became the company xe2 x80 x99s lifeblood as well as the model for all subsequent computer interfaces  but jobs xe2 x80 x99s apparent failure to correct the problem quickly led to tensions in the company  and in sculley convinced apple xe2 x80 x99s board of directors to remove the company xe2 x80 x99s famous cofounder   p7    h4  next and pixar  jobs quickly started another firm   next inc   designing powerful workstation computers for the education market  his funding partners included texan  entrepreneur   ross perot  and canon inc   a japanese electronics company  although the next computer was notable for its engineering design  it was eclipsed by less costly computers from competitors such as  sun microsystems  inc   in the early 1990s jobs focused the company on its innovative software system   nextstep   p8   meanwhile  in jobs acquired a controlling interest in  pixar   a  computer graphics  firm that had been founded as a division of lucasfilm ltd   the production company of hollywood movie director  george lucas   over the following decade jobs built pixar into a major animation studio that  among other achievements  produced the first full length feature film to be completely computer animated   toy story   in 1995  pixar xe2 x80 x99s public stock offering that year made jobs  for the first time  a billionaire  he eventually sold the studio to the  disney company  in 2006   p9    h5  saving apple  in late apple  saddled by huge financial losses and on the verge of collapse  hired a new chief executive   semiconductor  executive  gilbert amelio  when amelio learned that the company  following intense and prolonged research efforts  had failed to develop an acceptable replacement for the macintosh xe2 x80 x99s aging  operating system   os   he chose nextstep  buying jobs xe2 x80 x99s company for more than  million xe2 x80 x94and bringing jobs back to apple as a consultant  however  apple xe2 x80 x99s board of directors soon became disenchanted with amelio xe2 x80 x99s inability to turn the company xe2 x80 x99s finances around and in june requested apple xe2 x80 x99s prodigal cofounder to lead the company once again  jobs quickly forged an alliance with apple xe2 x80 x99s  erstwhile  foe  the  microsoft corporation   scrapped amelio xe2 x80 x99s mac clone agreements  and simplified the company xe2 x80 x99s product line  he also engineered an award winning advertising campaign that urged potential customers to  xe2 x80 x9cthink different xe2 x80 x9d and buy macintoshes  just as important is what he did not do  he resisted the temptation to make machines that ran microsoft xe2 x80 x99s  windows os   nor did he  as some urged  spin off apple as a software only company  jobs believed that apple  as the only major personal computer maker with its own operating system  was in a unique position to innovate   p10  steve jobs with an imac computer  1998  moshe brakha ap  ml10   innovate he did  in 1998  jobs introduced the  imac   an egg shaped  one piece computer that offered high speed processing at a relatively modest price and initiated a trend of high fashion computers   subsequent models sported five different bright colours   by the end of the year  the imac was the nation xe2 x80 x99s highest selling personal computer  and jobs was able to announce consistent profits for the once moribund company  the following year  he triumphed once more with the stylish ibook  a laptop computer built with students in mind  and the g4  a desktop computer sufficiently powerful that  so apple boasted  it could not be exported under certain circumstances because it qualified as a  supercomputer   though apple did not regain the industry dominance it once had  steve jobs had saved his company  and in the process reestablished himself as a master high technology marketer and visionary   p11    h6  reinventing apple  in jobs started reinventing apple for the 21st century  that was the year that apple introduced  itunes   a  computer program  for playing music and for converting music to the compact  mp3  digital format commonly used in computers and other digital devices  later the same year  apple began selling the  ipod   a portable mp3 player  which quickly became the market leader  in apple began selling downloadable copies of major record company songs in mp3 format over the  internet   by more than one billion songs and videos had been sold through apple xe2 x80 x99s online itunes store  in recognition of the growing shift in the company xe2 x80 x99s business  jobs officially changed the name of the company to apple inc  on january 9  2007   p12  steve jobs  courtesy of apple  ml12   in jobs took the company into the telecommunications business with the introduction of the touch screen  iphone   a  mobile telephone  with capabilities for playing mp3s and videos and for accessing the internet  later that year  apple introduced the ipod touch  a portable mp3 and gaming device that included built in  wi fi  and an iphone like touch screen   bolstered  by the use of the itunes store to sell apple and third party software  the iphone and ipod touch soon boasted more games than any other portable gaming system  jobs announced in that future releases of the iphone and ipod touch would offer improved game functionality  in an  ironic  development  apple  which had not supported game developers in its early years out of fear of its computers not being taken seriously as business machines  was now staking a claim to a greater role in the gaming business to go along with its move into telecommunications   p13    h7  health issues  in jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of  pancreatic cancer   he put off surgery for about nine months while he tried  alternative  medicine approaches  in he underwent a major reconstructive surgery known as the whipple operation  during the procedure  part of the  pancreas   a portion of the bile duct  the gallbladder  and the duodenum were removed  after which what was left of the pancreas  the bile duct  and the intestine were reconnected to direct the gastrointestinal secretions back into the stomach  following a short recovery  jobs returned to running apple   p14   throughout jobs lost significant weight  which produced considerable speculation that his cancer was back   the average survival rate for patients who underwent whipple operations was only percent at five years   perhaps more than those of any other large corporation  apple xe2 x80 x99s  stock market  shares were tied to the health of its ceo  which led to demands by investors for full disclosure of his health xe2 x80 x94especially as the first reasons given for his weight loss seemed insufficient to explain his sickly appearance  on january 9  2009  jobs released a statement that he was suffering from a hormonal imbalance for which he was being treated and that he would continue his corporate duties  less than a week later  however  he announced that he was taking an immediate leave of absence through the end of june in order to recover his health  having removed himself  at least temporarily  from the corporate structure  jobs resumed his previous stance that his health was a private matter and refused to disclose any more details   p15   in june the  wall street journal  reported that jobs had received a liver transplant the previous april  not disclosed was whether the pancreatic cancer he had been treated for previously had spread to his liver  the operation was performed in tennessee  where the average waiting period for a liver transplant was days  as opposed to the national average of days  jobs came back to work on june 29  2009  fulfilling his pledge to return before the end of june  in january 2011  however  jobs took another medical leave of absence  in  august  he resigned as ceo but became chairman  he died two months later   p16   steven levy  the editors of encyclopaedia britannica   end of content   learn more  in these related britannica articles         computer  apple inc
