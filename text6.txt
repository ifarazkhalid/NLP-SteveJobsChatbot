where     the son of francis jacob  jerry  wozniak  1925 xe2 x80 x931994  from  michigan  1    and margaret louise wozniak  n xc3 xa9e kern   1923 xe2 x80 x932014   16   from  washington  state     1    he graduated from  homestead high school  in 1968  the name on wozniak  s birth certificate is  stephan gary wozniak   but steve  s mother said that she intended it to be spelled  stephen   which is what he uses   1    wozniak has mentioned his surname being polish  17   and ukrainian  18   and spoken of his polish descent   19   but stated that he does not know the origin of some other people with the wozniak surname because he is  no heritage expert    17   in the early 1970s  wozniak was known as  berkeley blue  in the  phone phreak  community  after he made a  blue box    2   20   wozniak has credited watching  star trek  and attending  star trek  conventions  while in his youth as a source of inspiration for his starting  apple inc    21    career   edit    origins of apple   edit    in 1969  wozniak returned to the bay area after being expelled from  university of colorado boulder  in his first year for sending prank messages on the university  s computer system   22   23   during this time  as a self taught project  wozniak designed and built a  cream soda  computer with his friend  bill fernandez    24   he later re enrolled at  de anza college  and transferred to  university of california  berkeley  in 1971  before focusing his attention on apple  he was employed at  hewlett packard   hp  where he designed calculators   25   it was during this time that he befriended  steve jobs    26   wozniak was introduced to jobs by fernandez  who attended  homestead high school  with jobs in 1971  jobs and wozniak became friends when jobs worked for the summer at hp  where wozniak too was employed  working on a  mainframe computer    27   this was recounted by wozniak in a interview with  abc news   of how and when he first met jobs    we first met in during my college years  while he was in high school  a friend said    you should meet steve jobs because he likes electronics  and he also plays pranks    so he introduced us    26    in 1973  jobs was working for  arcade game  company  atari  inc   in  los gatos  california    28   he was assigned to create a  circuit board  for the arcade video game  breakout   according to atari co founder  nolan bushnell   atari offered   equivalent to  in 2017  for each chip that was eliminated in the machine  jobs had little knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if wozniak could minimize the number of chips  wozniak reduced the number of chips by 50  by using  ram  for the brick representation  too complex to be fully comprehended at the time  the fact that this prototype also had no scoring or coin mechanisms meant woz  s prototype could not be used  jobs was paid the full bonus regardless  jobs told wozniak that atari gave them only  and that wozniak  s share was thus   equivalent to  1 in 2017    29   wozniak did not learn about the actual  5 bonus  equivalent to  27 in 2017  until ten years later  but said that if jobs had told him about it and had said he needed the money  wozniak would have given it to him   30   on june 29  wozniak tested his first working prototype  displaying a few letters and running sample programs  it was the first time in history that a  character  displayed on a tv screen was generated by a home computer   1   with the apple i design  he and jobs were largely working to impress other members of the  palo alto  based  homebrew computer club   a local group of electronics hobbyists interested in computing  the club was one of several key centers which established the home hobbyist era  essentially creating the microcomputer industry over the next few decades  unlike other homebrew designs  the apple had an easy to achieve video capability that drew a crowd when it was unveiled   31    apple formation and success   edit    see also   history of apple  xc2 xa7 xc2 xa01975 xe2 x80 x931985  jobs and wozniak    original apple computer in a briefcase  from the  sydney powerhouse museum  collection  in 1976  wozniak developed the computer that eventually made him famous  he alone designed the hardware  circuit board designs  and operating system for the  apple i    31   wozniak originally offered the design to hp while working there  but was denied by the company on five different occasions   32   jobs instead had the idea to sell the  apple i  with wozniak as a fully assembled  printed circuit board   wozniak  at first skeptical  was later convinced by jobs that even if they were not successful they could at least say to their grandkids they had had their own company  together they sold some of their possessions  such as wozniak  s hp  scientific calculator  and jobs    volkswagen van    raised  1 300  and assembled the first boards in jobs   bedroom and later  when there was no space left  in jobs   garage  wozniak  s apartment in san jose was filled with monitors  electronic devices  and some computer games wozniak had developed  the apple i sold for  666 66   wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the  mark of the beast   and  i came up with  it  because i like repeating digits    jobs and wozniak sold their first system boards to  paul terrell   who was starting a new computer shop  called the byte shop  in  mountain view  california    1   on april 1  1976  jobs and wozniak formed  apple computer   now called apple inc   along with administrative supervisor  ronald wayne   whose participation in the new venture was short lived  wozniak resigned from his job at  hewlett packard  and became the vice president in charge of research and development at apple  he and jobs decided on the name  apple  shortly after jobs returned from an  apple orchard  in oregon   33   wozniak  s apple i was similar to the  altair   the first commercially available microcomputer  except the apple i had no provision for internal expansion cards  with expansion cards the altair could attach to a computer terminal and be programmed in  basic   in contrast  the apple i was a hobbyist machine  wozniak  s design included a  microprocessor    mos   on a single circuit board with bytes  of  rom   4k or 8k bytes of  ram   and a 40 character by 24 row display controller  apple  s first computer lacked a case  power supply  keyboard  and display  all components the user had to provide     an  apple ii  computer with an external  modem  after the success of the apple i  wozniak designed the  apple ii   the first personal computer that had the ability to display color graphics  and basic programming language built in   1   inspired by  the technique  atari  used to simulate colors on its first  arcade games    wozniak found a way of putting colors into the  ntsc  system by using a  chip   34   while colors in the  pal  system were achieved by  accident  when a dot occurred on a line  and to this day he has no idea how it works   35   during the design stage  steve jobs argued that the apple ii should have two  expansion slots   while wozniak wanted eight  36    after a heated argument  during which wozniak had threatened for jobs to   go get himself another computer    they decided to go with eight slots  the apple ii became one of the first highly successful mass produced personal computers in the world  in 1980  apple went public to instant and significant financial profitability  making jobs and wozniak both millionaires  the apple ii  s eventual successor  the  apple iii   released the same year  was not nearly as successful as the apple ii  according to wozniak  the apple iii  had percent hardware failures   and that the primary reason for these failures was that the system was designed by apple  s marketing department  unlike apple  s previous engineering driven projects   37   during the early design and development phase of the  macintosh 128k   wozniak had heavy influence over the project until 1981  in a interview  wozniak said that  steve  jobs  really took over the project when i had a plane crash and wasn  t there    14   5    airplane crash   edit    on february 7  1981  the  beechcraft bonanza  a36tc wozniak was piloting crashed soon after takeoff from the  sky park airport  in  scotts valley    california    38   the plane stalled while climbing  then bounced down the runway  went through two fences  and crashed into an embankment  wozniak and his three passengers xe2 x80 x94then fianc xc3 xa9e  candice clark   her brother jack clark  and his girlfriend  janet valleau xe2 x80 x94were injured  wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries  including losing a tooth  and also suffered for five weeks after the crash from  anterograde amnesia   the inability to create new memories  he had no memory of the crash  and did not remember his name in the hospital or the things he did after he was released   37   39   he would later state that apple ii computer games are what helped him regain his memory   1   the  national transportation safety board  investigation report cited premature liftoff and pilot inexperience as probable causes of the crash   40   wozniak did not immediately return to apple after recovering from the airplane crash  seeing it as a good reason to leave   37    us festivals   edit      wozniak in in may and 1983  wozniak  with help from professional concert promotor  bill graham   founded and sponsored two  us festivals  to celebrate evolving technologies  they ended up as a technology exposition and a rock festival as a combination of music  computers  television and people  after losing several million dollars on the festival  he stated that unless the event turned a profit  he would end his involvement with rock festivals and get back to designing computers   41   later that year  wozniak returned to apple product development  desiring no more of a role than that of an engineer and a motivational factor for the apple workforce   1    departure from apple   edit      wozniak and  andy hertzfeld  at an apple computer users group meeting in in the mid 1980s he designed the  apple desktop bus   a  proprietary   bit serial   peripheral bus  introduced on many later  macintosh  and  next  computer models  however  even with the success he helped create at apple  wozniak felt that the company was hindering him from being who he wanted to be  and that it was  the bane of his existence    42   he enjoyed engineering  not management  and said that he missed  the fun of the early days    15   although its products provided about 85  of apple  s sales in early 1985  the company  s january annual meeting did not mention the apple ii division or employees  a move that frustrated wozniak   43   as other engineers joined the growing company  he no longer felt needed there and by early 1985  wozniak left apple again  stating that the company had  been going in the wrong direction for the last five years   he then sold most of his stock   43    post apple career   edit    after his career at apple  wozniak enrolled at uc berkeley to complete his degree  because his name was well known at this point  he enrolled under the name rocky raccoon clark  which is the name listed on his diploma   44   one thing wozniak wanted to do was teach elementary school because of the important role teachers play in students   lives  eventually  he did teach computer

continues to represent the company at events or in interviews   15   today he receives a stipend from apple for this role  estimated to be  120 per year   1   48   15   he is also an apple shareholder   49   he maintained a friendly acquaintance with steve jobs until jobs   death in october 2011   50   however  in 2006  wozniak stated that he and jobs were not as close as they used to be   51   in a interview  wozniak said that the original  macintosh   failed  under steve jobs  and that it was not until jobs left that it became a success  he called the  apple lisa  group the team that had kicked jobs out  and that jobs liked to call the lisa group  idiots for making  the lisa computer  too expensive   to compete with the lisa  jobs and his new team produced a cheaper computer  one that  according to wozniak  was  weak    lousy  and  still at a fairly high price    he made it by cutting the ram down  by forcing you to swap disks here and there   says wozniak  he attributed the eventual success of the macintosh to people like  john sculley   who worked to build a macintosh market when the apple ii went away    14   silicon valley comic con   svcc  is an annual  pop culture
