but stated that he was more interested in capturing jobs   essence than his appearance  in regards to how he aimed to depict jobs  fassbender stated he aimed to depict jobs as a  somebody who was passionate about his vision  as opposed to a cruel person   5   kate winslet  as  joanna hoffman    apple and  next  marketing executive and jobs   confidant in the film   4   when discussing her audition for the film  winslet later commented that she  heard about it through a crew member who i happened to be working with  in australia on  the dressmaker    i didn  t even care what role it was  i just wanted to be in it  found out the nature of the role  googled  hoffman   found one picture of her  got my husband to go to a wig shop  buy a short haired dark wig  stuck it on my head  sent a photograph of myself to  producer  scott rudin  danny boyle came to melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part    6   winslet spent considerable time with  joanna hoffman  to prepare for the role before production began  she noted that hoffman  has a softness to her  she came to america as a young woman and achieved a great deal  one thing that was unique about her as a figure in steve  s life was that she didn  t need anything from him  she just needed for him to be the best version of himself  and that  s what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues    7   winslet credits hoffman  s difficult childhood  that began in armenia  with her ability to manage jobs   8     on the nature of the relationship between hoffman and jobs  winslet said that she and fassbender  were able to develop as literally co workers  i do believe it was very similar to the relationship that steve and joanna had  she was like his work wife  she was head of marketing for the macintosh  and then she stayed with him for his working life  she was an extraordinary  feisty eastern european person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into steve  and she was also kind of an emotional compass   in developing her sense of the character  winslet stated that she  just wanted to please  hoffman  as much as i could  how she sounds  and her accent  is fairly complicated  she grew up largely in armenia  spent some time in poland  and has russians in her family  so she has all three accents  but she  s been in america since she was a teenager  so she had american rhythms  you know  she really has this accent that goes way up and down  it  s almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes  so i had to put it into my own register  but we were all doing accents  i mean  michael  s irish  and he  s playing steve jobs  for god  s sake    7   finally  winslet notes that hoffman  did genuinely love  jobs   and spending time with her  when i was figuring out how to play this difficult part  she would become very emotional  she misses him terribly    8   seth rogen  as  steve wozniak    co founder of apple and creator of the  apple ii    4   rogen admitted to not being familiar with wozniak  let alone knowing he was co founder of apple  he met with wozniak to prepare for the film  specifically picking up his tendency to move his hands around while speaking   9   10   in regards to wozniak  s relationship with jobs  rogen stated that  his feelings towards jobs were very complex and interesting  part of it was taking it at face value and part was reading between the lines    8   wozniak stated that he felt honored to be portrayed by rogen in the film   11   jeff daniels  as  john sculley   ceo of apple from to  4   katherine waterston  as  chrisann brennan   jobs   former girlfriend and lisa  s mother  michael stuhlbarg  as  andy hertzfeld   a member of the

sorkin officially confirmed that he was writing the script   15   and had enlisted the help of  steve wozniak   co founder of apple  for historical accuracy   16   sorkin later stated that his screenplay would consist of three 30 minute long scenes covering years of jobs   life   17   18   19   sorkin developed the screenplay around jobs   relationship with a few key people  apple co

well as her mother  chrisann brennan    8   sorkin had a chance to speak with all of them while developing the screenplay  including lisa  who did not communicate with isaacson while he was developing his book   however  sorkin has stated that much of the dialogue is fiction   8   after sorkin  s completion of the script in january 2014  development on the project began to heat up when  david fincher  entered negotiations to direct the film   20   with fincher selecting  christian bale  as his choice for jobs   21   however  in april 2014  fincher exited the project due to contractual disputes   22    danny boyle  was then hired to direct  with  leonardo dicaprio  in discussions for the role   23   in october  dicaprio exited  with bale   matt damon    ben affleck  and  bradley

frontrunner to replace him  and  scarlett johansson  reportedly being offered a role before sony put the project in  turnaround  28   29   and  universal pictures  acquired it   30   following the  sony pictures entertainment hack  in december 2014  sony emails were leaked which revealed casting demands as cause of delay in the film  s production  also revealed in the emails were the details

seen early in the film during dialogue between the fictionalized jobs and wozniak   principal photography  began on january 16  2015  at jobs  s childhood home in  los altos  california    43   with additional scenes shot throughout the  san francisco bay area    44   production next moved to  berkeley  on january 23 xe2 x80 x9324   at  la m xc3 xa9diterran xc3 xa9e   a restaurant on college

in late february  production moved to  san francisco  and took place at the  opera house    louise m  davies symphony hall   and the  civic center    49   filming wrapped on april 10  2015  after an overnight shoot in the  san francisco bay area    50   51   to distinguish each of the three product launches depicted in the movie  danny boyle and cinematographer  alwin k xc3 xbcchler  implemented three different film formats   16mm  for 1984   35mm  for 1988  and  digital  for 1998  they also wanted each of the film  s three time periods to visually reflect jobs   own development at the time  for instance  k xc3 xbcchler explains that the filming at  flint center  de anza college  for the first act combined the graininess of 16 xc2 xa0mm film and setting to accentuate a provisional  spontaneous look  xe2 x80 x93 much in the vein of how jobs is portrayed at that time  the third act  shot with an  arri alexa  at the  davies symphony hall   incorporated an aesthetic and color palette that were intended to be representative of jobs   own design philosophies of the  imac  and subsequent  apple  hardware  k xc3 xbcchler describes his experience filming  steve jobs  as  brilliant and challenging at the same time   and that the goal was to  make sure that the visuals kept up with the words   in reference to the production  s collaboration between boyle and sorkin   52   53   54   55   56   costume designer  suttirat anne larlarb  says the real jobs never wore his trademark turtleneck jumper at any of the launches   the turtleneck was the off book decision  in those actual launches  in real life  he never wore that  in the portion of the film  in real life he was wearing a dark greyish brownish suit  we made it for him as a back up idea in case we needed to adhere to it  as we got closer to the time of filming  i thought we  d set up rules for 1984  we  d set up rules for  xe2 x80 x93 there  s so much of the film that  s about design and he was about design    57   fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black turtleneck for the third act was intentional  believing that wearing the attire  felt like i had arrived at  steve jobs    vision  that the person had arrived   fassbender later added that he and  danny boyle  decided on this look during filming  and wanted to  give the audience kind of a payoff    58   59    post production   edit    london based studio union created the film  s  visual effects    60   according to editor  elliot graham   extensive film editing took place even before principal photography was completed  during the one week rehearsal that took place in between production for each of the three acts  shot in chronological order   graham would work on the existing footage and receive ongoing feedback from boyle in the editing room  in an interview with  variety   graham said a particular challenge for him was balancing the  shot frequency  and providing enough  visual interventions  to control for sorkin  s dialogue heavy screenplay  he described approaching each scene as  a series of fight sequences   michael fassbender provided multiple versions of his performance as jobs  which graham and boyle would then choose from during  post production    61   62   63   graham also said   danny would be involved a lot but also take time away  he would say   if i  m with you the whole time  we  ll always have the same opinions because we  re on the exact same journey      64    music   edit    steve jobs  original motion picture soundtrack film score   soundtrack album  by  daniel

the low profile of fassbender in the title role  and that the underperformance at the box office could hurt the film  s award chances   82   after his film was pulled from wide release in the u s

boyle  s  electric  direction  temperamentally complements sorkin  s highly theatrical three act study  and praised fassbender in the role  who  doesn  t closely physically resemble the man   yet  he fully delivers the essentials of how we have come to perceive the man    87   justin chang of  variety  extolled the film as  a wildly creative fantasia   a brilliant  maddening  ingeniously designed and monstrously self aggrandizing movie    88    sasha stone   writing for  thewrap   stated that fassbender gives  a stunning knockout  performance as jobs in a film that is  a kind of talk opera   which to some might seem to be  sorkin overkill but the same could be said for the best of them   david mamet    edward albee    paddy chayefsky  and even  william shakespeare   sorkin is not trying to do anything but write in his own style  thus this film and its exceptional dialogue leaves its mark as profoundly as jobs himself left his    89   eric kohn of  indiewire  gave the film a  b    stating that  the cast vanishes into their parts   buried under makeup and a distinctive polish accent  winslet  s chameleonesque transformation is bested only by fassbender  whose vivid expressions and constant movement turn him into a physical marvel   he also noted that boyle  drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece    90   benjamin lee of  the guardian  gave the film three out of five stars  writing that  despite the film constantly informing you of just how incredibly important everything all is  it  s disappointingly difficult to truly care about what  s taking place   he blames sorkin  s  dominating  script  arguing that  the dialogue stifles  and that  the actors are tasked with trying to wrangle enough breathing space to offer up something of their own   he also feels that while it is  boyle  s best film for years   his direction  plays second fiddle  to a script that verges on a kind of  apple sponsored hero iworship    91    joe nocera  of  the new york times   who knew jobs well  took issue with  how little the film has to do with the flesh and blood steve jobs   characterizing the movie as pure  fiction   he went on to say   in ways both large and small  sorkin  xe2 x88 x92 as well as michael fassbender  the actor who plays jobs  xe2 x88 x92 has failed to capture him in any meaningful sense    92    historical accuracy   edit    danny boyle   the film  s director  speaking on the creative liberties he took with portraying steve jobs said    it  was what  shakespeare  used to do  he would take some of the facts about a man of power and he would guess at a lot of the rest and just gotten away at actually getting at the human in it  and that  s what  s wonderful about the writing i think  is that it acknowledges the people who disliked steve jobs  the people he hurt  but in the end  he brings it back to a very simple father daughter relationship that he has to admit that he has made some of the most beautiful things in the world    93   john sculley  praised  jeff daniels    portrayal of him  but claims the film misrepresented  apple   s success with the  mac   and argues that jobs was  much nicer  than depicted   94   95   96    bill atkinson  denounced the film as  not truthful at all  that wasn  t his character  and the events didn  t happen  you think of jobs having a  reality distortion field   i think of aaron sorkin as having     a history distortion field   atkinson said that  the only thing he got right in that movie  was the  spot on  depiction of hoffman  including her accent and how she  tried to rein in steve from     making an ass of himself    97   steve wozniak   who consulted with sorkin before he had written the screenplay  commented on a trailer released on july 1  that he does not  talk that way    i would never accuse the graphical interface of being stolen  i never made comments to the effect that i had credit  genius  taken from me    the lines i heard spoken were not things i would say but carried the right message  at least partly    i felt a lot of the real jobs in the trailer  although a bit exaggerated    11   wozniak did not ask to see the final script because he did not  think that would be appropriate    it is the creative work of the producer and writer and actors and director and others    11   he also noted that the trailer  s reference to jobs   initial rejection of his daughter  lisa  evoked an emotional response   it was hard on me  even being quiet  when jobs refused to acknowledge his child when the money didn  t matter  and i can almost cry remembering it    11   in september 2015  after seeing a rough cut of the film  wozniak stated that he felt like he  was actually watching steve jobs and the others        not actors playing them  i give full credit to danny boyle and aaron sorkin for getting it so right    98   in an interview with  san francisco chronicle  on february 10  2016  wozniak claimed that the film  s scenes between him and jobs never occurred in reality  wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested jobs to acknowledge the  apple ii  team onstage  as was shown in the movie  however  he added that jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards the group  when asked about the accuracy of the film  s portrayal of jobs  wozniak replied   in real life  to real people  that  s the way he could be  very sharp   although  never quite as much as in the movie    99   edwin catmull   president of  pixar animation studios  and  walt disney animation studios   felt that jobs would  be appalled  at his depiction in the film  arguing that he was a kinder person later in life than is portrayed in the picture  in an interview with  the hollywood reporter   catmull commented   when  jobs  left apple  he then entered into what really is the classic  hero  s journey   he  s wandering in the wilderness  he  s working with next  it  s not working  he  s working with pixar  we  re failing  in that process  steve learned some major lessons  and he changed  he became an empathetic person        that aspect of the change of steve was missed    100   in a  bloomberg west  interview with  emily chang  on august 26  2015   andy cunningham  called it  a wonderful film     it  s an incredible character study of a really complex man  aaron  sorkin  and danny boyle did a fabulous job with it   her portrayal by  sarah snook  was a  small role but professionally done    101   the film also portrays andy as participating in the imac launch  even though she was not working with apple at that time   102   journalist  walt mossberg  compared  steve jobs  to the  orson welles  film  citizen kane   which was loosely based on the life of  william randolph hearst   mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well developed  welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction  in contrast  according to mossberg  who knew jobs for years   sorkin  s decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction  mossberg states that  the steve jobs portrayed in sorkin  s film isn  t the man i knew  sorkin chose to cherry pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of jobs   character  and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature       it would be as if you made a movie called  jfk  almost entirely focused on kennedy  s womanizing and political rivalries  and said nothing about civil rights and the  cuban missile crisis   sorkin opts to end his story just as jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world changing products and to mature into a much broader  kinder manager and person    103    accolades   edit    main article   list of accolades received by steve jobs  film   steve jobs  has received dozens of industry and critics awards  the film garnered four
