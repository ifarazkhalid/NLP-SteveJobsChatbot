jobs was born on february 24  in san francisco  california  his unwed biological parents  joanne schieble and abdulfattah jandali  put him up for adoption  steve was adopted by paul and clara jobs  a lower middle class couple  who moved to the suburban city of mountain view a couple of years later   the santa clara county  south of the bay area  became known as silicon valley in the early 1950s after the sprouting of a myriad of semi conductor companies  as a result  young steve jobs grew up in a neighborhood of engineers working on electronics and other gizmos in their garages on weekends  this shaped his interest in the field as he grew up  at age 13  he met one the most important persons in his life  18 year old stephen wozniak  an electronics wiz kid  and  like steve  an incorrigible prankster     paul jobs and his young son steve  age 2  five years later  when steve jobs reached college age  he told his parents he wanted to enroll in reed college  xe2 x80 x94 an expensive liberal arts college up in oregon  even though the tuition fees were astronomical for the poor couple  they had promised their son  s biological parents he would get a college education  so they relented  steve spent only one semester at reed  then dropped out  as he was more interested in eastern philosophy  fruitarian diets  and lsd than in the classes he took  he moved to a hippie commune in oregon where his main activity was cultivating apples   a few months later  steve returned to california to look for a job  he was hired at the young video game maker atari  and used his wages to make a trip to india with one of his college friends  in order to   seek enlightenment    he came back a little disillusioned and started to take interest in his friend woz  s new activities   apple  s origins  woz  whose interest in electronics had grown stronger  was regularly attending meetings of a group of early computer hobbyists called the homebrew computer club  they were the real pioneers of personal computing  a collection of radio jammers  computer professionals and enlightened amateurs who gathered to show off their latest prowess in building their own personal computer or writing software  the club started to gain popularity after the altair personal computer kit came out in 1975   the knowledge that woz gathered at the homebrew meetings  as well as his exceptional talent  allowed him to build his own computer board  xe2 x80 x94 simply because he wanted a personal computer for himself  steve jobs took interest  and he quickly understood that his friend  s brilliant invention could be sold to software hobbyists  who wanted to write software without the hassle of assembling a computer kit  jobs convinced wozniak to start a company for that purpose  apple computer was born on april 1  1976     steve jobs and steve wozniak with an apple i  the following months were spent assembling boards of apple i computers in the jobses   garage  and selling them to independent computer dealers in the area  however  wozniak had started work on a much better computer  the apple ii  xe2 x80 x94 an expandable  much more powerful system that supported color graphics  jobs and wozniak knew deep down it could be hugely successful  and therefore jobs started to seek venture capital  he eventually convinced former intel executive turned business angel mike markkula to invest  250 in apple  in january 1977  markkula was a big believer in the personal computing revolution  and he said to the young founders that  thanks to the apple ii  their company could be one of the fortune in less than two years      aasj in article  responsive banner        end aasj in article  responsive banner      apple ii forever  although markkula was a bit too optimistic about apple  s growth rate  he was right that the company quickly became an american success story  because of its beautiful package  ease of use  and nifty features  the apple ii crushed most of its competition and its sales made the apple founders millionaires  the biggest surge in sales came after the introduction of visicalc  the first commercially successful spreadsheet program  hundreds of thousands of americans  whether they be accountants  small business owners  or just obsessed with money  bought apple iis to make calculations at home     jobs posing with apple ii for an advertisement  in the wake of apple  s success  its investors decided it was time to go public  the ipo took place in december 1980  only four years after the company was started  steve jobs  s net worth increased to over  million  at age 25   apple  s success attracted the attention of the computer giant ibm  which until then was still only selling mainframe computers to large companies  a crash project was started and in august 1981  the ibm pc entered the personal computer market  it was the biggest threat yet to apple  whose reputation was being put into question after the flop of the apple iii in 1980  most hopes rested on a business computer project  called the lisa   lisa   xerox parc    steve and his newborn daughter lisa  jun steve jobs was a big believer in the lisa computer initially  it was he who came up with the name  indeed  in 1978  his ex girlfriend from high school chrisann brennan gave birth to a little girl  who she named lisa  steve denied paternity  although it was ovious to everyone who knew him that he was the father  given the on and off relationship he still had with chrisann at the time  jobs refused to give any money to chrisann  despite the millions he had accumulated at apple  while in denial  he came up with the name lisa for the new computer apple was building     the following year  a tour of the computer research lab xerox parc made a huge impression on him  the scientists who worked there had invented a number of breakthrough technologies that would mark the industry for the coming decades  including the graphical user interface  gui  and the mouse  ethernet  laser printing and object oriented programming  jobs became obsessed with the gui which was a lot easier to use than the command line interfaces of the day  which required any pc user to learn a computer language  he insisted the lisa had a gui and a mouse  too   macintosh  however  because of his hot temper and his relative inexperience in technology or management  steve jobs was thrown out of the lisa project  he felt absolutely crushed by this decision  as a revenge  he took over a small project called macintosh  a personal computer that was supposed to be a cheap appliance    as easy to use as a toaster    in 1981  steve jobs became head of the macintosh project  and decided to make it a smaller and cheaper version of the lisa  complete with a gui of folders  icons and drop down menus  and a mouse     steve jobs and macintosh at his home in los altos  by norman seef    the three years it took to develop macintosh were some of the most productive and intense for steve jobs  he formed a small group of dedicated  young  brilliant engineers who stood fully behind his vision of a computer   for the rest of us    they saw themselves as   pirates   against the rest of apple    the navy    the team antagonized both the apple ii group and the lisa group  because the mac was competitive of both  yet in 1983  after it became clear the lisa was turning into another major flop for apple  all of the company  s hope started to rest on the macintosh  steve was supported in his mission by john sculley  apple  s new ceo whom he hired in to help him run the company and groom him into a future chief executive   leaving apple  on january 1984  after apple had run a very memorable tv commercial for the superbowl    1984     steve jobs introduced macintosh at the company  s annual shareholders meeting  the product was launched in great fanfare and for the first few months  it was very successful   however  by early 1985  sales were plummeting  but steve jobs refused to acknowledge it and continued to behave as if he had saved apple  this created a lot of tension within the company  especially between steve and the ceo  john sculley  who used to be very close but now stopped talking to one another   in may 1985  steve jobs started trying to convince some directors and top executives at apple that sculley should go  instead  many of them talked to sculley  who took the matter to the board of directors  the board sided with sculley and a few days later  announced a reorganization of the company where steve jobs had no operational duties whatsoever  xe2 x80 x94 he was only to remain chairman of the board   steve was aghast  apple was his life  and he was effectively kicked out of it  after four months spent traveling and trying out new ideas  he came back in september with a plan  he would start a new computer company aimed at higher education  with a small group of other ex apple employees  when apple learned of the plan  they declared they would sue him as he was taking valuable information about the company to compete with it  as a result  steve jobs resigned in september 1985  and sold all but one of his apple shares  in disgust  he went ahead with his plan anyway  and incorporated next  apple dropped its lawsuit a few months later   the next years  steve aimed at the highest possible standards for his new next machine  he wanted the best hardware  built in the world  s most automated factory  and running the most advanced software possible  he decided that the computer  s operating system  nextstep  would be based on unix  the most robust system in the world   used by the military and universities xe2 x80 x94 but that it would also be as easy to use as a macintosh with its own gui  nextstep would allow for object oriented programming  another breakthrough from xerox parc  that made writing software much faster and more reliably  these ambitious plans put off the release date of the computer  xe2 x80 x94 called the next cube  xe2 x80 x94 to october 1988     steve jobs at the next cube introduction  oct when it came out  the next cube was indeed a great machine  but it didn  t sell  xe2 x80 x94 it was late  and way too overpriced  universities has asked for a  3 computer  and steve jobs had built a  10 workstation  after two years of very low sales  next launched the cheaper next station  and expanded its target to businesses  in addition to higher ed  it didn  t work  the number of next computers sold each month remained in the hundreds  the company was bleeding money and all its co founders left one after the other  as well as its most prominent investor  texan billionaire ross perot  by 1993  next had to give up its entire hardware business to become a niche software company  steve jobs had failed  and he was devastated  he started focusing less on work  and more on his wife laurene  who he married in 1991  and his newborn son  reed     zen guru kobun chino as he wed laurene powell and steve jobs  mar pixar  to understand how steve jobs got out of his nadir  let  s go back eight years earlier  in late 1985  at the time  george lucas  who was in the middle of an expensive divorce  was selling the computer graphics division of his lucasfilm empire  steve jobs had millions in the bank  after having sold all his apple stock  and was interested  in early 1986  he bought the small group of computer scientists  and incorporated it as pixar  the founders of pixar  ed catmull and alvy ray smith  had gotten together in the late 1970s with a common vision of making films using computer animation only  but they also knew no computer was powerful enough at the time  and they would have to hold out for a couple decades before their dream could materialize   for the first five years of pixar  steve jobs set a goal for the company to sell high end computer graphics workstations for institutions  such as hospitals or even the army  the animations group led by john lasseter was very small at the time  and only survived because it provided good publicity for the power of the pixar rendering software  steve jobs understood this when the studio won an academy award for its short movie   tin toy   in 1989  however  just like next  s  sales of pixar hardware were microscopic  and the company went software only in 1990   pixar then became a software company  developing the renderman 3d rendering software  its animation business was kept alive because it was the only one that brought some cash in  with various 3d tv commercials for consumer brands  however a decisive contract changed everything  in 1991  disney signed with pixar for making a full feature computer animated movie  the script had to be fully approved by both parties  and the very hands on head of disney animation jeffrey katzenberg halted the production several times out of creative disagreements with john lasseter and his team  but in 1995  the movie was finally starting to take form  and steve jobs became increasingly enthused by it     john lasseter and steve jobs  although he had used his personal money to fund pixar for nine years  jobs had never been implicated that much in the company  which was always more of a   hobby   to him compared to next  but by 1995  next had more or less tanked  whereas pixar was obviously going to benefit widely from the disney marketing machine and make a hit with toy story  steve understood this new momentum full well  he planned to take pixar public the week following the release of the movie  in november 1995  he was right  and toy story  s box office success was only surpassed by the pixar stock  s success on wall street  steve jobs  who owned 80  of the company  saw his net worth rise to over  billion  xe2 x80 x94 five times the money he had ever made at apple in the 1980s   back to apple  business wasn  t all sunshine and roses at apple  in the decade following steve  s departure  the computer maker had milked all the cash it could from the macintosh and its successors  surfing on the wave of the desktop publishing revolution that the mac and the laser printer had made possible  but in 1995  after microsoft had released windows 95  which was a pale but working copy of the mac os  sales of macintosh computers started plummeting   a new ceo  gil amelio  arrived in early to save the company  he cut costs  got rid of a third of the workforce  and decided that instead of writing a new  modern operating system from scratch to compete with window  it was better for apple to acquire one  eventually  amelio chose to buy nextstep  next  s operating system  xe2 x80 x94 and steve jobs convinced him to buy the whole company  for a whopping  million  the deal was made in december 1996  steve jobs was back at the company he founded     steve jobs and apple ceo gil amelio after the announcement of apple  s acquisition of next  dec the amelio jobs cooperation didn  t last long  though  apple lost  million in the first quarter of 1997  and the board decided to get rid of its ceo  jobs effectively organized a board coup with the complicity of his billionaire friend larry ellison  and after a tenure that lasted exactly days  amelio was gone  in august 1997  jobs took the stage at macworld boston to explain his plan for apple  he had gotten rid of the old board of directors  and made a deal with microsoft to settle patent disputes and invest  million in the struggling silicon valley icon  one month later  on september 16  1997  jobs accepted to become apple  s interim ceo   for the loser now will be later to win  the few months after steve jobs came back at apple were among the hardest working in his life  he later told his biographer walter isaacson that he was so exhausted  he couldn  t speak when he came home at night  remember he was also running a thriving pixar simultaneously   he reviewed every team at apple and asked them to justify why they were important to the future of the company  if they couldn  t  their product would get canceled  and there was a high probability they  d have to leave  too  jobs also brought with him his executive team from next  and installed them in key positions   critics started to believe in steve jobs  s ability to run apple when he unveiled his first great product  the imac  introduced in may 1998  it was apple  s first truly innovative product since the original macintosh of 1984  its translucent design blew away the whole pc industry  which had failed to produce anything but black or beige boxes for over a decade  moreover  it was a hot seller  and played a key role in bringing back tons of developers to the mac platform  design innovations continued throughout and with the colored imacs and the ibook  apple  s consumer notebook  after three years in charge  steve jobs had brought apple back to its status of cool tech icon     steve jobs and the original imac  may at macworld in january 2000  steve jobs made two significant announcements  first  he demoed aqua  the graphics intensive user interface that apple would use in its next generation operating system derived from nextstep  mac os x  second  he announced he had accepted the apple board  s offer  and became the company  s ceo  dropping the   interim   from his title  it was not an obvious choice because he remained ceo of pixar  too  mac os x had not shipped yet  though  and would take another year to ship   the simple fact that such a massive os transition happened is a technical feat in itself  the mac os x team worked very hard and released six major version of the system every year or so  between and 2007  each time with more stability  rapidity  and features  although steve jobs buried mac os on stage in 2002  most observers acknowledge that the transition from the old mac os to os x was really finished only in 2005  with the release of mac os x tiger  the continuous improvement of mac os x and the powerful core technologies and development tools it provided proved key in the digital hub strategy that steve jobs described in january 2001   the digital hub  once apple had been resurrected by the imac  steve jobs started focusing on ways to make the company  s shrinking marketshare  around 5  of pcs  grow  he decided to use apple  s unique knowledge of making both the hardware and the software to do just that  not only would macs be very powerful and attractive machines  but they would also run software that no windows pcs could  his first move was to bet on what he called   desktop video    the ability to shoot and edit personal movies on your mac  he was convinced that desktop video would be as big a deal as desktop publishing had been in the 1980s  and in 1999  he introduced the imac dv and a digital movie editing software  imovie  to pioneer that concept     steve jobs introducing the imac dv  oct the imac dv was a hit  but desktop video failed to catch on as jobs had hoped  after a much introspection  in 2000  the apple executive team came up with a new paradigm for the mac that would set the company  s destinies for the coming decade  they took the idea of desktop video and decided to expand it to the other consumer digital devices that were rapidly becoming mainstream at the time  apple would write software for the mac to edit and store all the new digital content that consumers created  xe2 x80 x94 and these apps would be so powerful  delightful and easy to use  that they would entice pc users to switch to the mac  the digital hub strategy was born  steve jobs explained it to the apple community at macworld in january 2001  the same day he unveiled the 2nd and 3rd of the iapps  idvd  to shares imovies with family and friends on dvds  and itunes  a digital jukebox software  other iapps would follow  iphoto in 2002  garageband in 2004  and iweb in 2006   2001  an apple odyssey  in many ways  the juggernaut that apple became was shaped by very smart decisions that jobs and his executive team took in the crucial 2000 timeframe  we  ve talked of mac os x and the digital hub strategy  a crucial product and a crucial strategy that were both unveiled in january 2001   a third key decision was taken in and unveiled in mid 2001  that of creating a fully owned retail channel  the famous apple retail stores  although it is easy to approve of this strategy in retrospect  it was far from an obvious choice back in may 2001  when the first two retail stores were inaugurated  pc maker gateway was shutting down its own retail stores one after the other  and the analysts consensus at the time was that niche player apple would burn precious money in this economic downturn on a foolish and dated idea  on the other hand  steve jobs explained that only in an environment fully controlled by apple  with apple trained staff and only apple compatible products  could the superiority of macs be fully appreciated by consumers     steve jobs at the genius bar of the new york soho apple store  jul finally  it was in that jobs started realizing his mistake of betting only on digital movies  and reoriented the company  s efforts to another media  music  digital music file sharing service napster was at the peak of its popularity  and all the young people were not spending their time shooting movies  but rather downloading and listening to mp3 music files  itunes was born out of that realization  but there was a problem  although there were great digital camcorders to run in conjunction with imovie  and awesome digital cameras too  digital music players mostly sucked  xe2 x80 x94 not to mention their universal ugliness   that  s why  in march 2001  steve jobs started a crash development program to develop an apple branded mp3 player before that year  s holiday season  the ipod was born  on october 23  2001  he introduced this cute white digital device to a small group of journalists in the company  s campus auditorium  the tagline was   1 songs in your pocket    and there was great emphasis on its symbiosis with the itunes app  but no one in the room  jobs included  had any clue how important it would turn out to the company  s future   ipod nation  the first digital music player that people loved  ipod was a commercial success from the day it debuted  it was released  of course  as mac compatible only  because its goal  just like imovie or idvd  was to help sales of macs  but it came at a time when a lot of people needed a good mp3 player  and despite its rather high price tag  a lot of pc users ended up buying it too  hacking it so they could use it on their machines  this had steve jobs and his team think a great deal  should they keep making a mac only ipod  or should they open it to windows  too  although jobs was opposed to the latter idea  he eventually relented  and the first windows ipods were introduced in july at macworld new york     itunes store for windows introduction  oct however  it was soon becoming clear that ipod benefited from music piracy  and that its sales could go even higher if there was a legal way to download music  steve jobs didn  t wait for the music industry to reinvent itself  he went to all record labels to negotiate landmark deals that would lead to the introduction of the itunes music store in april 2003  ironically  one of the arguments he used was that the risk to music labels was quite low  because of the mac  s small market share  itunes was still mac only   the first compelling legal alternative to illegal music file sharing  the itunes store was an instant success  selling one million songs in its first week  it not only helped the sales of ipods  but it eventually reshaped the whole music industry  it was introduced to windows as well six months later  in october 2003   despite this great success  apple didn  t rest on its laurels  in january 2004  it introduced the ipod mini  a more compact version of ipod that sold at  249  only  less than the full featured ipod  it is really after ipod mini came out that ipod became the cultural icon it is now known as  the phrase   walkman of the digital age   became commonplace to describe it  and in july 2004  steven levy of newsweek wrote an emblematic cover story entitled   ipod nation    the ipod adventure was far from over  since apple introduced the  ipod shuffle and the   impossibly small   ipod nano in 2005  and the ipod video in 2006  by that time  ipod had become synonymous with music player  and the itunes store had sold over one billion songs     on the cover of newsweek  jul although ipod changed the music industry and the way everybody listen to music  the most important change it carried was probably that of apple  the wild success of ipod proved to all the company  s employees  starting with jobs himself  that they were right to strive for perfection and ease of use  xe2 x80 x94 unlike the mac  which still didn  t make it past the 5  marketshare  ipod garnered microsoft like numbers of 80  of sales of mp3 players  it was ipod that revealed the future of apple  not only as a pc manufacturer  but as a consumer electronics powerhouse  it was also ipod that broadened the company  s expertise in the manufacturing  logistics and distribution of a mainstream digital device in gigantic proportions  finally  it was ipod which  through the crowds it attracted to the company  s retail stores  finally helped the mac business of apple  whose growth rate outpaced that of windows pcs starting in 2005   when pixar met disney    steve jobs and disney ceo michel eisner at a press conference  ipod also played an indirect role in shaping the future of steve  s   other   company  pixar  after having released hit after hit  a bug  s life  1998   toy story  1999   monsters inc   2001  and finding nemo  2003    the animation studio had decided to let go of its distribution deal with disney  mainly because of increasing tensions between steve jobs and disney ceo michael eisner  steve jobs openly said he would not make another deal with the magic kingdom company until eisner was out  turns out his opinion was shared by many an executive at disney  xe2 x80 x94 including walt  s own nephew  roy disney  who started a public campaign to oust the company  s ceo in late 2003  th led to the nomination of bob iger as new ceo in september 2005   rumor has it that one of the first phone calls iger made after he became ceo was to pixar ceo steve jobs  he was willing to show his good will in ending the pixar disney dispute  steve jobs took the opportunity to pitch him his new apple plan  he was going to introduced an ipod with video capabilities soon  and he wanted a movie store to go along with it  iger accepted  and both men appeared on stage in october to announce that disney would sell music videos and tv shows on itunes  the audience of journalists was pleasantly surprised to see the ceo of disney appear so friendly with steve jobs  and suspected there would soon be news on the pixar side     john lasseter  steve jobs  bob iger and ed catmull announcing the pixar disney merger at the pixar campus  jan indeed  on january 24  2006  disney announced its friendly acquisition of pixar  putting  billion in stock on the table  jobs became a disney board member and its largest individual shareholder  owning 7  of the company  s stock   while pixar executives ed catmull and john lasseter were both given critical roles in the new studio   momentum  meanwhile  apple was seeing unprecedented success in all its businesses  not only ipod and itunes  the retail stores were hugely popular  and a milestone was reached when steve jobs inaugurated the impressive 5th avenue store in new york city  a glass cube facing central park  as for the mac  it was gaining momentum on the market  benefiting from both the aura of the ipod  and the switch to intel     steve jobs announces the move to intel at wwdc  jun indeed  in june 2005  at wwdc  jobs made a surprise announcement that after over a decade using the powerpc microprocessor architecture in macs  apple would start using the more power efficient intel platform  in the late 1990s  apple had run several ads to make fun of intel  s pentium processors  which were commonplace in the windows world  as a matter of fact  the expression   wintel machines    windows   intel  was often used to describe pcs  that move to intel was thus pretty bold  but in the long run turned out to be another wise decision  not only did it make macs more efficient  and pave the way for the super slim macbook air notebooks  but it also opened up a whole new set of customers of apple  intel macs could run both mac os x  and its unix terminal  and windows  and became the platform of choice for the majority of developers  all macs were running intel less than a year after the announcement   apple inc   ipod made steve jobs realize that apple could become the greatest consumer electronics company on the planet  around 2003  he started a secret project to develop a tablet  but in 2004 2005  he realized that the technology that this group had developed  including a revolutionary touch screen technology  could be used in a phone rather than a tablet  after two more years of development  including a harsh internal competition to prove that it was possible to make mac os x run on the phone  iphone was introduced at macworld on january 9  2007  this keynote is often considered the best and most memorable of all of steve jobs  s career     the iphone introduction  macworld  jan iphone was not only a breakthrough digital convergence device   an ipod  a phone  and an internet communicator  all in one   it was also a force of disruption of the traditional phone business  just like for the itunes store  steve jobs had negotiated landmark deals with wireless carrier at t before he introduced iphone  xe2 x80 x94 without ever showing it to them  in exchange for exclusivity  the carrier would pay apple a share of all their iphone subscription revenues  and of course  at t could not put any software on the iphone  and no logo either  this was an inversion of the traditional master slave relationship that carriers entertained with phone manufacturers  in the long run  it really put the phone industry upside down   unlike ipod  all of apple understood that iphone would be a successful and rules changing device  starting with their own company  that  s why steve jobs announced that its name would change from apple computer inc  to apple inc  macs still mattered  but accounted for a minority of apple  s revenues already  and this decline would not stop any time soon  apple had become the most prominent digital device company   the original iphone was successful already  despite its  price tag  apple sold million of them during its existence  but sales really started to skyrocket in 2008  after apple introduced the cheaper iphone 3g  at a subsidized  price  and the app store  just like the windows compatible ipod  steve jobs was originally opposed to letting third party software on the iphone  but the demand was so high that he eventually relented  and introduced the iphone sdk and the app store in march 2008     portrait with iphone  by joe pugliese    it is impossible to overestimate the impact of the iphone app store  which ushered in a new era in mobile software  thousands of developers started writing apps for the iphone platform  which became a competitive advantage for apple that no other company has been able to catch up with to this day  apple proudly showed off this rich choice of software in its tv ad campaign   there  s an app for that   that ran for over two years   health concerns  unfortunately  while he had never been so successful professionally  steve jobs had to start fighting cancer with renewed intensity   in late 2003  he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer of a rare kind  that could potentially be cured by surgery  however  against everyone  s advice  he refused to have the surgery for nine long months  instead  true to the ideals of his youth  he tried alternative diets and treatments  including acupuncture and seeing a psychic  only in july did he agree to have the surgery  he looked healthy for the next five years  and spoke publicly of being   cured   of cancer at his famous stanford speech in 2005     a thinner steve jobs on stage at the  let  s rock  special event  sep yet at the wwdc keynote in june 2008  few observers failed to notice how thin he appeared on stage  and concerns about his health started popping up again  they became increasingly frequent until december 2008  when apple made a shocking announcement that jobs would not be the keynote speaker at macworld 2009  and that he was taking a medical leave of absence for six months  although he publicly denied it  the truth was of course that his cancer had come back  he was actually weeks away from death when he received a liver transplant in april 2009  but he came back to apple  as planned  in late summer 2009  healthier though still very frail in appearance  he was eager to bring the finishing touches to a new project very dear to his heart   ushering in the post pc era  the iphone had spun off the idea for a tablet device back in 2005  and it was time to restart that project  which of course led to the introduction of ipad  although some speculated it would run mac os x  it was decided that ipad would in fact run the same operating system as iphone  now called ios  it would therefore benefit from the rich variety of apps already present in the iphone app store     ipad introduction  jan although ipad was welcomed by mixed reviews when it was introduced in january  some dubbed it a  larger ipod touch    it was always clear to steve jobs that it was   the biggest thing  he  d  ever done    xe2 x80 x94 the ultimate post pc device  an eventual replacement of pcs for the average user  he laid out his vision clearly at the d8 conference in may 2010  where he compared pcs to trucks  which still existed after cars were invented but were only for professional  niche use  this perspective on ipad was reiterated in a series of tv commercials where the narrator  the   apple voice    explained how revolutionary ipad was and how the revolution had   only just begun     unfortunately  steve jobs   health  which had seem to recover throughout 2010  started declining again  in january 2011  he announced he was taking a new medical leave of absence  this time without saying when it would end  everybody started talking about his upcoming departure  however  he deemed ipad and ios so important that he still made two major public presentations at apple event  the first one was the introduction of ipad in march 2011  and the second one was wwdc  in june 2011  where he introduced icloud   in many ways  the icloud announcement was of similar importance as the digital hub strategy introduction ten years before  it was not only a product  but a master plan to get consumers to adopt ios devices and lock them into the apple ecosystem  the icloud introduced in 2011  which allowed users to sync email  documents  and media across their macs  iphones  ipod touches  ipads and apple tvs  was only the first step in that direction  it was crucial to steve jobs who clearly put ios as the most important part of apple and the key to its future     steve and his wife laurene after the icloud introduction  his last keynote  jun building his legacy  the resurgence of steve  s cancer was a painful reminder that it was time to   put his affairs in order   before his passing  xe2 x80 x94 and he did   he made sure that apple was ready to operate without him  in late 2008  he hired the dean of the yale school of management to create   apple university    a sort of internal business track to groom future apple executives by exposing them to the apple ways of doing business  through actual case studies in the history of the company  he also consolidated his executive team and agreed with the board that his natural successor would be his second in command  coo tim cook  finally  at his last public appearance in june 2011  he unveiled his plans for the future apple campus in cupertino  a huge spaceship sized building in the shape of a perfect circle  all of this was in place when  because of his increasingly deteriorating health  he resigned as apple ceo on august 24  2011   jobs also prepared his personal legacy  in 2009  he finally started giving interviews to journalist walter isaacson to prepare for his first and only authorized biography  giving him his perspective on his life and career  he also spent his last days designing a boat for his family on which he hoped to travel the world  unfortunately  death took him too soon  and he died peacefully at home on october 5  2011  surrounded by his family  xe2 x80 x94 the day following the introduction of the iphone 4s  an apple
