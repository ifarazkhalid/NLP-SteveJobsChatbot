page xc2 xa0needed    as a hobby  paul jobs rebuilt cars  but his career was as a   repo man    which suited his  aggressive  tough personality    7    page xc2 xa0needed    meanwhile  their attempts

schieble did not want to aggravate him  and both felt that at they were too young to marry   4    page xc2 xa0needed    in addition  as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother  and as abortions were illegal and dangerous  adoption was the only option women had in the united states in 1954   7    page xc2 xa0needed    according to jandali  schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process   without telling me  joanne upped and left to move to san francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing  including me     she did not want

couple paul and clara jobs  neither of whom had a college education  and schieble refused to sign the adoption papers   4    page xc2 xa0needed    she then took the matter to court in an attempt to have her baby placed with a different family  10    page xc2 xa0needed    and only consented to releasing the baby to paul and clara after they promised that he would attend college   4    page xc2 xa0needed    when steve jobs was in high school  his mother clara admitted to his girlfriend  17 year old  chrisann brennan   that she  was too frightened to love  steve  for the first six months of his life     i was scared they were going to take him away from me  even after we won the case  steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two i felt we had made a mistake  i wanted to return him    10    page xc2 xa0needed    when chrisann shared his mother  s comment with steve  he stated that he was already aware of that  10    page xc2 xa0needed    and would later say he was deeply loved and indulged by paul and clara   11    page xc2 xa0needed    many years later  steve jobs  s wife laurene also noted that  he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents    11    page xc2 xa0needed    jobs would become upset when paul and clara were referred to as  adoptive parents  as they  were my parents 1 000     4    page xc2 xa0needed    with regard to his biological parents  jobs referred to them as  my sperm and egg bank  that  s not harsh  it  s just the way it was  a sperm bank thing  nothing more    4    page xc2 xa0needed    jandali has also stated that  i really am not his dad  mr  and mrs  jobs are  as they raised him  and i don  t want to take their place    9    childhood    i always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid  but i liked electronics  xe2 x80 xa6 then i read something that one of my heroes   edwin land of polaroid   said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences  and i decided that  s what i wanted to do     xe2 x80 x94steve jobs  4    page xc2 xa0needed      paul and clara adopted jobs  s sister patricia in  4    page xc2 xa0needed    and the family moved to  mountain view  california   in 1961   7    page xc2 xa0needed    it was during this time that paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to  pass along his love of mechanics    4    page xc2 xa0needed    jobs  meanwhile  admired his father  s craftsmanship  because he knew how to build anything  if we needed a cabinet  he would build it  when he built our fence  he gave me a hammer so i could work with him     i wasn  t that into fixing cars     but i was eager to hang out with my dad    4    page xc2 xa0needed    by the time he was ten  jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood   7    page xc2 xa0needed    he had difficulty making friends with children his own age  however  and was seen by his classmates as a  loner    7    page xc2 xa0needed       childhood home of jobs in  los altos  california  that served as the original site of  apple computer   the home was added to a list of historic los altos sites in  12   jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom  tended to resist authority figures  frequently misbehaved and was suspended a few times   7    page xc2 xa0needed    clara had taught him to read as a toddler  and jobs stated that he was  pretty bored in school and  had  turned into a little terror    you should have seen us in the third grade  we basically destroyed the teacher    7    page xc2 xa0needed    he frequently played pranks on others at monta loma elementary school in mountain view   4    page xc2 xa0needed    his father paul  who was abused as a child  never reprimanded him  however  and instead blamed the school for not placing enough challenge on his brilliant son   4    page xc2 xa0needed    jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher  imogene   teddy   hill  with turning him around   she taught an advanced fourth grade class and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation  she bribed me into learning  she would say    i really want you to finish this workbook  i  ll give you five bucks if you finish it    that really kindled a passion in me for learning things  i learned more that year than i think i learned in any other year in school  they wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn  t let it happen    7    page xc2 xa0needed    jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at crittenden middle school in mountain view  7    page xc2 xa0needed    where he became a  socially awkward loner    4    page xc2 xa0needed    jobs  was often bullied  and gave his parents an ultimatum  they had to either take him out of crittenden or he would drop out of school  though the jobs family was not well off  they used all their savings in to buy a new home  which would allow jobs to change schools   7    page xc2 xa0needed    the new house  a three bedroom home on crist drive in  los altos  california   was in the better  cupertino school district    cupertino  california    4    page xc2 xa0needed    and was embedded in an environment that was even more heavily populated with engineering families than the mountain view home   7    page xc2 xa0needed    the house was declared a historic site in as it was the first site for apple computer  12   and is now owned by patty and occupied by jobs  s step mother marilyn   13   when he was in 1968  jobs was given a summer job by  bill hewlett   of  hewlett packard   after jobs cold called him to ask for parts for an electronics project   he didn  t know me at all  but he ended up giving me some parts and he got me a job that summer working at hewlett packard on the line  assembling frequency counters   well  assembling may be too strong  i was putting in screws  it didn  t matter  i was in heaven    7    page xc2 xa0needed    bill fernandez   a fellow electronics hobbyist who was in jobs  s grade at cupertino junior high  was his first friend after the move  fernandez later commented that  for some reason the kids in the eighth grade didn  t like  jobs  because they thought he was odd  i was one of his few friends   fernandez eventually introduced jobs to 18 year old electronics whiz and homestead high  alum   steve wozniak   who lived across the street from fernandez   homestead high  the location of the los altos home meant that jobs would be able to attend nearby  homestead high school   which had strong ties to  silicon valley    4    page xc2 xa0needed    he began his first year there in late along with fernandez   7    page xc2 xa0needed    neither jobs nor fernandez  whose father was a lawyer  came from engineering households and thus decided to enroll in john mccollum  s  electronics 1    7    page xc2 xa0needed    mccollum and the rebellious jobs  who had grown his hair long and become involved in the growing counterculture  would eventually clash and jobs began to lose interest in the class  he also had no interest in sports and would later say that he didn  t have what it took to  be a jock  i was always a loner    7    page xc2 xa0needed    he underwent a change during mid 1970   i got stoned for the first time  i discovered shakespeare   dylan thomas   and all that classic stuff  i read  moby dick  and went back as a junior taking creative writing classes    7    page xc2 xa0needed    jobs also later noted to his official biographer that  i started to listen to music a whole lot  and i started to read more outside of just science and technology xe2 x80 x94 shakespeare    plato   i loved  king lear      when i was a senior i had this phenomenal  ap english class   the teacher was this guy who looked like  ernest hemingway   he took a bunch of us snowshoeing in yosemite   from that point  jobs developed two different circles of friends  those who were involved in electronics and engineering and those who were interested in art and literature   4    page xc2 xa0needed    these dual interests were particularly reflected during jobs  s senior year as his best friends were wozniak and his first girlfriend  the artistic homestead junior  chrisann brennan    10    page xc2 xa0needed    in after wozniak began attending  university of california  berkeley   jobs would visit him there a few times a week  this experience led him to study in nearby  stanford university   s student union  jobs also decided that rather than join the electronics club  he would put on light shows with a friend for homestead  s avant garde jazz program  he was described by a homestead classmate as  kind of a brain and kind of a hippie     but he never fit into either group  he was smart enough to be a nerd  but wasn  t nerdy  and he was too intellectual for the hippies  who just wanted to get wasted all the time  he was kind of an outsider  in high school everything revolved around what group you were in  and if you weren  t in a carefully defined group  you weren  t anybody  he was an individual  in a world where individuality was suspect   by his senior year in late 1971  he was taking freshman english class at stanford and working on a homestead underground film project with chrisann   7    page xc2 xa0needed    in mid 1972  after graduation and before leaving for  reed college   jobs and brennan rented a house from their other roommate  al   10    page xc2 xa0needed    14   during the summer  brennan  jobs  and  steve wozniak  found an advertisement posted on the  de anza college  bulletin board for a job that required people to dress up as characters from  alice in wonderland    brennan portrayed alice while wozniak  jobs  and al portrayed the white rabbit and the mad hatter   10    page xc2 xa0needed     reed college    i was interested in  eastern mysticism  which hit the shores about then  at  reed  there was a constant flow of people stopping by  xe2 x80 x93 from  timothy leary  and  richard alpert   to  gary snyder   there was a constant flow of intellectual questioning about the truth of life  that was the time when every college student in the country read  be here now  and  diet for a small planet      xe2 x80 x94steve jobs  7    page xc2 xa0needed      later in the year  jobs enrolled at  reed college  in  portland  oregon   reed was an expensive school that paul and clara could ill afford  and they were spending much of their life savings on their son  s higher education   4    page xc2 xa0needed    brennan remained involved with jobs while he was at reed  she also met his friend at reed   daniel kottke   for the first time   10    page xc2 xa0needed    jobs also became friends with reed  s student body president   robert friedland    7    page xc2 xa0needed    brennan was now a senior at homestead  and she did not have plans to attend college  she was supportive of jobs when he told her that he planned to drop out of reed because he did not want to spend his parents   money on it  neither her father nor jobs  s adoptive parents had gone to college   jobs continued to attend by auditing his classes  which included a course on  calligraphy  that was taught by  robert palladino   jobs was no longer an official student  and brennan stopped visiting him  jobs later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the reed campus  but she refused  he had started seeing other women  and she was interested in someone she met in her art class  brennan speculated that the house was jobs  s attempt to make their relationship monogamous again   10    page xc2 xa0needed    in a commencement speech at  stanford university   jobs stated that during this period  he slept on the floor in friends   dorm rooms  returned coke bottles for food money  and got weekly free meals at the local  hare krishna  temple  in that same speech  jobs said   if i had never dropped in on that single  calligraphy  course in college  the mac would have never had multiple  typefaces  or proportionally spaced fonts    15    1972 xe2 x80 x931985   i was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and idealistic industry  there weren  t many degrees offered in computer science  so people in computers were brilliant people from mathematics  physics  music  zoology  whatever  they loved it  and no one was really in it for the money       there are people around here who start companies just to make money  but the great companies  well  that  s not what they  re about     xe2 x80 x94steve jobs  16     pre apple  in mid 1973  jobs moved back to the  san francisco bay area  and was renting his own apartment  brennan states by this point that their  relationship was complicated  i couldn  t break the connection and i couldn  t commit  steve couldn  t either   jobs hitchhiked and worked around the west coast and brennan would occasionally join him  at the same time  brennan notes   little by little  steve and i separated  but we were never able to fully let go  we never talked about breaking up or going our separate ways and we didn  t have that conversation where one person says it  s over   they continued to grow apart  but jobs would still seek her out  and visit her while she was working in a health food store or as a live in babysitter  they remained involved with each other while continuing to see other people   10    page xc2 xa0needed   in 1973   steve wozniak  designed his own version of the classic video game  pong   after finishing it  wozniak gave the board to jobs  who then took the game down to  atari  inc   in  los gatos  california   atari thought that jobs had built it and gave him a job as a  technician    17   18   atari  s cofounder  nolan bushnell  later described him as  difficult but valuable   pointing out that  he was very often the smartest guy in the room  and he would let people know that    19   by early 1974  jobs was living what brennan describes as a  simple life  in a  los gatos  cabin  working at  atari   and saving money for  his impending trip  to  india   brennan visited him twice at the cabin  she states in her memoir that her memories of this cabin consist of jobs reading  be here now   and giving her a copy   listening to  south indian  music  and using a japanese meditation pillow  brennan felt that he was more distant and negative toward her  brennan states in her memoir that she met with jobs right before he left for  india  and that he tried to give her a  bill that he had earned at  atari   she initially refused to accept it but eventually accepted the money   10   jobs traveled to india in mid  20   to visit  neem karoli baba  21   at his kainchi  ashram  with his reed friend  and eventual apple employee   daniel kottke   in search of  spiritual enlightenment   when they got to the neem karoli ashram  it was almost deserted because neem karoli baba had died in september 1973   18   then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of  haidakhan babaji   in india  they spent a lot of time on bus rides from  delhi  to  uttar pradesh  and  himachal pradesh    18   after staying for seven months  jobs left india  22   and returned to the us ahead of daniel kottke   18   jobs had changed his appearance  his head was shaved and he wore traditional indian clothing   23   24   during this time  jobs experimented with  psychedelics   later calling his  lsd  experiences  one of the two or three most important things  he had  done in  his  life    25   26   he spent a period at the all one farm  a  commune  in  oregon  that was owned by  robert friedland   brennan joined him there for a period   10    page xc2 xa0needed    during this time period  jobs and brennan both became practitioners of  zen   buddhism  through the zen master  k xc5 x8dbun chino otogawa   jobs was living with his parents again  in their backyard toolshed which he had converted into a bedroom with a sleeping bag  mat  books  a candle  and a meditation pillow   10    page xc2 xa0needed    jobs engaged in lengthy  meditation retreats  at the  tassajara zen mountain center   the oldest  s xc5 x8dt xc5 x8d zen  monastery in the us   27   he considered taking up monastic residence at  eihei ji  in  japan   and maintained a lifelong appreciation for zen   28   jobs would later say that people around him who did not share his  countercultural  roots could not fully relate to his thinking   25   jobs then returned to atari and was assigned to create a  circuit board  for the  arcade  video game  breakout   according to bushnell  atari offered  us for each  ttl  chip that was eliminated in the machine  jobs had little specialized knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if wozniak could minimize the number of chips  much to the amazement of atari engineers  wozniak reduced the ttl count to 46  a design so tight that it was impossible to reproduce on an assembly line   29   according to wozniak  jobs told him that atari gave them only   instead of the  5 paid out   and that wozniak  s share was thus  350   30   wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten years later  but said that if jobs had told him about it and explained that he needed the money  wozniak would have given it to him   4    104 xe2 x80 x93107  wozniak had designed a low cost digital   blue box   to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network  allowing free long distance calls  jobs decided that they could make money selling it  the clandestine sales of the illegal  blue boxes  went well and perhaps planted the seed in jobs  s mind that electronics could be both fun and profitable   31   jobs  in a interview  recalled that it took six months for him and wozniak to figure out how to build the blue boxes   32   jobs said that if not for the blue boxes  there would have been no apple  he states it showed them that they could take on large companies and beat them   33   34   jobs and wozniak attended meetings of the  homebrew computer club  in 1975  which was a stepping stone to the development and marketing of the first apple computer   35    apple  1976 xe2 x80 x931985   see also   history of apple  xc2 xa7 xc2 xa01975 xe2 x80 x931985  jobs and wozniak    basically steve wozniak and i invented the apple because we

chemical engineering at stanford  recalled dismissing jobs  s budding business     you punched cards  put them in a big deck    he said about the mainframe machines of that time    steve took me over

dismissed the whole idea      13   jobs  s friend from reed college and india   daniel kottke   recalled that as an early apple employee  he  was the only person who worked in the garage     woz would show up once a week with his latest code  steve jobs didn  t get his hands dirty in that sense   kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in jobs  s kitchen  where he spent hours on

the cofounders of  sun microsystems   said that jobs broke a   glass age ceiling   in silicon valley because he  d created a very successful company at a young age   34   markkula brought apple to the attention of  arthur rock   which after looking at the crowded apple booth at the home brew computer show  started with a  60 investment and went on the apple board   40      for what characterizes apple is that its scientific staff always acted and performed like artists  xe2 x80 x93 in a field filled with dry personalities limited by the rational and binary worlds they inhabit  apple  s engineering teams had passion  they always believed that what they were doing was important and  most of all  fun  working at apple was never just a job  it was also a crusade  a mission  to bring better computer power to people  at its roots that attitude came from steve jobs  it was   power to the people    the slogan of the sixties  rewritten in technology for the eighties and called

parents   home  where he was still living  it was during this period that jobs and brennan fell in love again  as brennan noted changes in him that she attributes to  kobun   whom she was also still following   it was also at this time that jobs displayed a prototype  apple computer  for brennan and his parents in their living room  brennan notes a shift in this time period  where the two main influences on jobs were  apple  and  kobun   by the early 1977  she and jobs would spend time together at her home at  duveneck ranch in los altos   which served as a hostel and environmental education center  brennan also worked there as a teacher for inner city children who came to learn about the farm   10    page xc2 xa0needed    in 1977  jobs and wozniak introduced the  apple ii  at the  west coast computer faire   it was the first consumer product sold by  apple computer  and was one of the first highly successful mass produced  microcomputer  products   41   it was designed primarily by  steve wozniak   jobs oversaw the development of the apple ii  s unusual case  4    page xc2 xa0needed    and  rod holt  developed the unique power supply   42   jobs usually went to work

was inspired by that of  stuart geman   a noted applied mathematics professor at brown university  jobs told his biographer walter isaacson     he came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself  both because of its daily convenience  the rationale he claimed  and its ability to convey a signature style    43   as jobs became more successful with his new company  his relationship with brennan grew more complex  in 1977  the success of apple was now a part of their relationship  and brennan   daniel kottke   and jobs moved into a house near the apple office in  cupertino    10    page xc2 xa0needed    brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at apple    10    page xc2 xa0needed    45   brennan  s relationship with jobs was deteriorating as his position with apple grew  and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes  in october 1977  brennan was approached by  rod holt   who asked her to take  a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the apples    10    page xc2 xa0needed    both holt and jobs felt that it would be a good position for her  given her artistic abilities  holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it  brennan  s decision  however  was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that jobs was the father  it took her a few days to tell jobs  whose face  according to brennan  turned ugly  at the news  at the same time  according to brennan  at the beginning of her third trimester  jobs said to her   i never wanted to ask that you get an abortion  i just didn  t want to do that    10    page xc2 xa0needed    he also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her   4    page xc2 xa0needed    brennan herself felt confused about what to do  she was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father  she also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion  she chose instead to discuss the matter with kobun  who encouraged her to have and keep the baby  and pledged his support  meanwhile  holt was waiting for her decision on the internship  brennan stated that jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship  stating she could  be pregnant and work at apple  you can take the job  i don  t get what the problem is    10    page xc2 xa0needed    brennan however notes that she  felt so ashamed  the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at apple  with the child being his  while he was unpredictable  in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous  i could not have endured it    10    page xc2 xa0needed    brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave apple  she stated that jobs told her  if you give up this baby for adoption  you will be sorry  and  i am never going to help you    10    page xc2 xa0needed    now alone  brennan was on welfare and cleaning houses to earn money  she would sometimes ask jobs for money but he always refused  brennan hid her pregnancy for as long as she could  living in a variety of homes and continuing her work with zen meditation  at the same time  according to brennan  jobs  started to seed people with the notion that i slept around and he was infertile  which meant that this could not be his child   a few weeks before she was due to give birth  brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the all one farm and she accepted the offer   10    page xc2 xa0needed    when jobs was  the same age as his biological parents when they had him   4    page xc2 xa0needed    brennan gave birth to her baby   lisa brennan   on may 17  1978   10    page xc2 xa0needed    46      dear  mike   this morning  s papers carried suggestions that apple is considering removing me as chairman  i don  t know the source of these reports  but they are both misleading to the public and unfair to me  you will recall that at last thursday  s board meeting i stated i had decided to start a new venture  and i tendered my resignation as chairman  the board declined to accept my resignation and asked me to defer it for a week  i agreed to do so in light of the encouragement the board offered with regard to the proposed new venture and the indications that apple would invest in it  on friday  after i told john sculley who would be joining me  he confirmed apple  s willingness to discuss areas of possible collaboration between apple and my new venture  subsequently the company appears to be adopting a hostile posture toward me and the new venture  accordingly  i must insist upon the immediate acceptance of my resignation  i would hope that in any statement it feels it must issue  the company will make it clear that the decision to resign as chairman was mine  i find myself both saddened and perplexed by the management  s conduct in this matter which seems to me contrary to apple  s best interests  those interests remain a matter of deep concern to me  both because of my past association with apple and the substantial investment i retain in it  i continue to hope that calmer voices within the company may yet be heard  some company representatives have said they fear i will use proprietary apple technology in my new venture  there is no basis for any such concern  if that concern is the real source of apple  s hostility to the venture  i can allay it  as you know  the company  s recent re organization left me with no work to do and no access even to regular management reports  i am but and want still to contribute and achieve  after what we have accomplished together  i would wish our parting to be both amicable and dignified  yours sincerely  steven p  jobs     xe2 x80 x94steve jobs  letter of resignation from  apple computer   september 17th  1985   7

publicly denying paternity   she would discover later that during this time  jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name  his first choice was  claire  after  st  clare    she also stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby  s name for a computer and he hid the plans from her  jobs also worked with his team to come up with the phrase   local integrated software architecture  as an  alternative explanation  for the  apple lisa    47   decades later  however  jobs admitted to his biographer  walter isaacson  that  obviously  it was named for my daughter    4    brennan would come under intense criticism from jobs  who claimed that  she doesn  t want money  she just wants me   according to brennan  apple  s  mike scott  wanted jobs to give her money  while other apple executives  advised him to ignore me or fight if i tried to go after a paternity settlement    10    page xc2 xa0needed    when jobs denied paternity  a  dna test  established him as lisa  s father  it required him to give brennan  a month in addition to returning the welfare money she had received  jobs gave her  a month at the time when apple went public

 threatened to stop developing mac applications unless it was granted  a license for the mac operating system software  microsoft was developing its graphical user interface     for dos  which it was calling  windows  and didn  t want apple to sue over the similarities between the windows gui and the mac interface    56    sculley granted microsoft the license which later led to problems for apple   56    in addition  cheap  ibm pc clones  that ran on microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear  although the macintosh preceded the clones  it was far more expensive  so  through the late 1980s  the windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from apple    56    windows based ibm pc clones also led to the development of additional guis such as ibm  s topview or digital research  s gem   56    and thus  the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted  undermining the most apparent advantage of

macintosh as a business alternative to the ibm pc  president and ceo sculley had little control over chairman of the board jobs  s macintosh division  it and the apple ii division operated like separate companies  duplicating services   58   although its products provided percent of apple  s sales in early 1985  the company  s january annual meeting  did not mention the apple ii division or employees  many left including wozniak  who stated that the company had  been going in the wrong direction for the last five years  and sold most of his stock   59   the macintosh  s failure to defeat the pc strengthened sculley  s position in the company  in may 1985  sculley xe2 x80 x94encouraged by arthur rock xe2 x80 x94decided to reorganize apple  and proposed a plan to the board that would remove jobs from the macintosh group and put him in charge of  new product development   this move would effectively render jobs powerless within apple   7    page xc2 xa0needed    in response  jobs then developed a plan to get rid of sculley and take over apple  however  jobs was confronted after the plan was leaked  and he said that he would leave apple  the board declined his resignation and

loud verbal arguments and it  s not my nature to do that      but we did disagree fairly frequently about things      i would say something to him and he would immediately shoot it down because he

 and sometimes this went on for months  but in the end one of three things happened  about a third of the time he said    oh  i get it  you  re right    and that was the end of it  and it was another third of the time in which  i  d  say    actually i think he is right    the other third of the time  where we didn  t reach consensus  he just let me do it my way  never said anything more about it
