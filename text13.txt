Jobs was  adopted  at birth. His birth parents wanted Steve to be adopted by college graduates, that was not the case. He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs who promised Steve would go to college. Jobs went to Reed College for a semester and then dropped out. He spent 18 more months dropping in on more creative classes. He also took part in ballet as a child.\n \n Founding of Apple Inc. [ change  |  change source ] \n He was a  Silicon Valley  businessman most famous for his work with the company Apple Computer Inc. which later changed to  Apple Inc. [7] \n Together with Apple co-founder  Steve Wozniak , Jobs helped make the idea of the  personal computer  popular in the late  1970s . In the early  1980s , still at Apple, Jobs was one of the first to see the  commercial  potential of using a  mouse  to use with the  GUI . [8]  During this period, Apple had hired a number of other people to be president of the company.\n He was a supporter of the  Democratic Party  of the  United States . [9]  He dropped out of high school.\n \n Out of Apple Inc., NeXT Computer and Pixar [ change  |  change source ] \n In 1985 Apple\'s Board of Directors fired Jobs from his position with the company. He then started  NeXT , a computer platform development company which dealt with higher education and business markets. Apple\'s 1997  buyout  of NeXT brought Jobs back to the company he co-founded where he worked as the CEO of Apple. He was paid $1m per year plus  stock options .  While Jobs was away from Apple, he bought a computer animation studio from film director  George Lucas  called  Pixar . [10]  Jobs later sold Pixar to Disney and gained a seat on the Disney  board of directors . Their first film from Pixar was  Toy Story  (1995) which was a huge success. Pixar went on to make films such as  Monsters, Inc.  (2001),  Finding Nemo  (2003),  Cars  (2006),  WALL-E  (2008),  Up  (2009), among others. Jobs actually made more money with Pixar than he did during his first stint with Apple.\n \n Introduction of the iPhone and retirement [ change  |  change source ] \n Jobs presented the  iPhone  on January 9, 2007. On August 24, 2011, Jobs retired as CEO of Apple. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]  He suggested  Tim Cook  as his  successor . Following Jobs\' request, Jobs continued as the  chairman  of the Apple Inc.\'s  Board of Directors . [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] \n \n Final years [ change  |  change source ] \n Jobs had health problems for the last few years and had a liver transplant.
