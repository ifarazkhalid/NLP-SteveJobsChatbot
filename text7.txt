He was the chairman, and the chief executive director(CEO), and a co-founder of Apple Inc; CEO and majority shareholder of Pixar;\xc2\xa0a member of The Walt Disney Company\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak\xc2\xa0are widely recognized as pioneers of the microcomputer revolution\xc2\xa0of the 1970s and 1980s. \n Jobs was born in San Francisco to parents who had to put him up for adoption at birth; he was raised in the San Fransisco Bay area\xc2\xa0during the 1960s.\xc2\xa0Jobs briefly attended Reed College\xc2\xa0in 1972 before dropping out. He then decided to travel through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Budhisum.\xc2\xa0Jobs\xe2\x80\x99s declassified FBI report stated that an acquaintance knew that Jobs had used the illegal drugs marijuana\xc2\xa0and LSD\xc2\xa0while he was in college.\xc2\xa0Jobs once told a reporter that taking LSD was \xe2\x80\x9cone of the two or three most important things\xe2\x80\x9d he did in his life. \n Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak\xe2\x80\x99s Apple I\xc2\xa0personal computer. The visionaries gained fame and wealth a year later for the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. In 1979, after a tour of PARC, Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface\xc2\xa0(GUI). This led to development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa\xc2\xa0in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh\xc2\xa0in 1984. In addition to being the first mass-produced computer with a GUI, the Macintosh introduced the sudden rise of the desktop publishing\xc2\xa0industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer\xc2\xa0to feature vector graphics. Following a long power struggle, Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985. \n After leaving Apple, Jobs took a few of its members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform\xc2\xa0development company that specialized in state-of-the-art computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, Jobs helped to initiate the development of the visual effects\xc2\xa0industry when he funded the spin out of computer graphics division of George Lucas\xe2\x80\x99s of Lucasfilms\xc2\xa0in 1986. The new company, Pixar, would eventually produce the first fully computer animated\xc2\xa0film,  Toy Story \xe2\x80\x94an event made possible in part because of Jobs\xe2\x80\x99s financial support. \n In 1997, Apple merged with NeXT. Within a few months of the merger, Jobs became CEO of his former company; he revived Apple at the verge of bankruptcy. Beginning in 1997 with the \xe2\x80\x9cThink diffrent\xe2\x80\x9d advertising campaign, Jobs worked closely with designer Jonathan Ive\xc2\xa0to develop a line of products that would have larger cultural ramifications: the iMac, iTunes\xc2\xa0and iTunes stores, Apple store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with a completely new Mac OS X, based on NeXT\xe2\x80\x99s NeXTSTEP\xc2\xa0platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. \n Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor\xc2\xa0in 2003 and died on October 5, 2011, of respiratoryarrest\xc2\xa0related to the tumor. \n  Facebook Comments Plugin for WordPress: http://peadig.com/wordpress-plugins/facebook-comments/    \n  Entery content end  \n \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags:  Appel Inc ,  Apple ,  businessman ,  entrepreneur ,  industrial designer ,  inventor ,  NeXT ,  Pixar ,  The Walt Disney Company   \n  Tags end  \n \n \n \n \n   Facebook \n \n \n \n   Twitter \n \n \n \n   Google + \n \n \n \n   Linkedin \n \n \n \n Whats App \n \n \n  Share items end  \n \n \n \n \n Previous Post \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Alexander Graham Bell\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \n \n \n \n \n Next Post  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  THE CAUSE OF THE LIGHTNING\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \n \n \n  Post navigation end  \n \n Related Posts \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n StemINSPIRE   \n \n Alexander Graham Bell \n \n \n JustScience \n 11 Aug,2017 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n Science Articles   \n \n APPLE PATENTS DISTRESS CALLING TECHNOLOGY \n \n \n JustScience \n 11 Aug,2017 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n StemINSPIRE   \n \n KNOW MORE ABOUT THOMAS EDISON \n \n \n JustScience \n 11 Aug,2017 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n Science Articles   \n \n THE LOCKING DOWN TECHNOLOGY BY FACEBOOK IS MAKING YOU SEE THINGS THAT AREN\xe2\x80\x99T ACTUALLY EVEN THERE \n \n \n JustScience \n 11 Aug,2017 \n \n \n \n \n  .row  \n \n \n \n   \n You may also like \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n Science Articles   \n The Only Two Certifications for Home Energy Auditors \n \n \n 07 Apr,2018 \n \n  Post content end  \n  Post Overaly Article end  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n Science Articles    Post thumb end  \n \n \n Beware of Home Energy Auditor Certification Scams \n \n \n 06 Apr,2018 \n \n  Post content end  \n  Post block style end  \n  Li 1 end  \n \n \n \n \n   \n  Post thumb end  \n \n \n Metal and Plastic Machine Workers \n \n \n 05 Apr,2018 \n \n  Post content end  \n  Post block style end  \n  Li 1 end  \n \n \n \n \n   \n  Post thumb end  \n \n \n Food and Tobacco Processing Workers \n \n \n 05 Apr,2018 \n \n  Post content end  \n  Post block style end  \n  Li 1 end  \n \n \n \n \n   \n  Post thumb end  \n \n \n Chefs and Head Cooks \n \n \n 05 Apr,2018 \n \n  Post content end  \n  Post block style end  \n  Li 1 end  \n  List post end  \n  List post block end  \n \n \n     \n Stem Career \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Post thumb end  \n \n \n Security Guards and Gaming Surveillance Officers \n \n \n Apr 03,2018 \n \n  Post content end  \n  Post Overaly Article end  \n \n \n \n \n \n  Post thumb end  \n \n \n Athletes and Sports Competitors \n \n \n Mar 31,2018 \n \n  Post content end  \n  Post Overaly Article end  \n  Item 1 end  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Post thumb end  \n \n \n Social and Human Service Assistants \n \n \n Mar 31,2018 \n \n  Post content end  \n  Post Overaly Article end  \n \n \n \n \n \n  Post thumb end  \n \n \n Social and Community Service Managers \n \n \n Mar 31,2018 \n \n  Post content end  \n  Post Overaly Article end  \n  Item 2 end  \n  Post slide carousel end  \n   \n Videos \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  Post thumb end  \n \n \n How to create air and electricity in east way \n \n  Post content end  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  Post thumb end  \n \n \n Technique for Rail Track Crack Indicator \n \n  Post content end  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  Post thumb end  \n \n \n How to use solar electricity system for making digital school \n \n  Post content end  \n \n \n \n    .sidebar .widget-area  \n \n \n  Footer main end  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n India\'s leading science and education online publication. \n <p class="footer-info-phone"><i class="fa fa-phone"></i> +(785) 238-4131</p>\n\t\t<p class="footer-info-email"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i> editor@indianwikimedia.com</p> \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Row end  \n  Container end  \n  Footer info end  \n \n \n \n \n \n Copyright \xc2\xa9 2018 JustScience All Rights Reserved.
