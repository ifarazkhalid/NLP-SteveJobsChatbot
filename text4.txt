when jobs arrived he didn  t immediately look at watson  but instead at the equipment  focusing on watson  s  4 xc3 x975 camera  before saying   wow  you  re shooting film    7    if you look at that shot  you can see the intensity  it was my intention that by looking at him  that you knew this guy was smart  i heard later that it was his favorite photograph of all time   xe2 x80 x94 xe2 x80 x89

even did a few yoga poses xe2 x80 x94he lifted his leg and put it over his shoulder xe2 x80 x94and i just thought we were two guys hanging out  chatting away  and enjoying the relationship  it wasn  t like there was a conceptualization here xe2 x80 x94this was completely off the cuff  spontaneity that we never thought would become an iconic image   xe2 x80 x94 xe2 x80 x89 norman seeff  9      the placeholder cover used for the book uses the  working title    isteve  the book of jobs    title   edit    the book  s  working title    isteve  the book of jobs   was chosen by publisher  simon   schuster   s publicity department  although author  walter isaacson  was  never quite sure about it   his wife and daughter reportedly were  however  they thought it was  too cutesy  and as a result isaacson persuaded the publisher to change the title to something  simpler and more elegant    10   the title  steve jobs  was allegedly chosen to reflect jobs  s  minimalist  style and to emphasize the biography  s authenticity  further differentiating it from unauthorized publications  such as  icon steve jobs  the greatest second act in the history of business  by jeffrey young   11
