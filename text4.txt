The book was written at the request of Jobs by  Walter Isaacson , a former executive at  CNN  and  TIME  who has written best-selling biographies of  Benjamin Franklin  and  Albert Einstein . [1] [2] \n Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years\xe2\x80\x94in addition to interviews with more than one hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues\xe2\x80\x94Isaacson was given "unprecedented" access to Jobs\'s life. [3]  Jobs is said to have encouraged the people interviewed to speak honestly. Although Jobs cooperated with the book, he asked for no control over its content other than the book\'s cover, and waived the right to read it before it was published. [4] \n The book was released on October 24, 2011, by  Simon & Schuster  in the United States, 19 days after Jobs\' death. [5] \n A  film adaptation  written by  Aaron Sorkin  and directed by  Danny Boyle , with  Michael Fassbender  starring in the title role, was released on October 9, 2015.\n \n Contents \n \n 1   Appearance \n \n 1.1   Front cover \n 1.2   Back cover \n 1.3   Title \n 1.4   Chapters \n \n \n 2   Film adaptation \n 3   Other media \n 4   Awards and honors \n 5   References \n \n \n Appearance [ edit ] \n   The book\'s cover photograph is similar to one taken previously by  Norman Seeff  and featured on  Rolling Stone . [6] \n Front cover [ edit ] \n The front cover uses a photo of Steve Jobs commissioned by  Fortune  magazine in 2006 for a portfolio of powerful people. The photograph was taken by  Albert Watson .\n When the photograph was taken, he said he insisted on having a three-hour period to set up his equipment, adding that he wanted to make "[every shoot] as greased lightning fast as possible for the [subject]." When Jobs arrived he didn\'t immediately look at Watson, but instead at the equipment, focusing on Watson\'s  4\xc3\x975 camera  before saying, "wow, you\'re shooting film." [7] \n \n If you look at that shot, you can see the intensity. It was my intention that by looking at him, that you knew this guy was smart. I heard later that it was his favorite photograph of all time. \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89 Albert Watson [7] \n \n Jobs gave Watson an hour\xe2\x80\x94longer than he had given most photographers for a portrait session. Watson reportedly instructed Jobs to make "95 percent, almost 100 percent of eye contact with the camera," and to "think about the next project you have on the table," in addition to thinking about instances when people have challenged him. [7] \n The title font is  Helvetica . [8] \n \n Back cover [ edit ] \n The back cover uses another photographic portrait of Jobs taken in his  living room  in  Woodside ,  California  in February 1984 by  Norman Seeff . In a  Behind the Cover  article published by  TIME  magazine, Seeff recalls him and Jobs "just sitting" on his living room floor, talking about "creativity and everyday stuff," when Jobs left the room and returned with a  Macintosh 128K  (the original Macintosh computer). Jobs "[plopped] down" in the  lotus position  holding the computer in his lap when Seeff took the photograph. [9] \n \n We did do a few more shots later on, and he even did a few yoga poses\xe2\x80\x94he lifted his leg and put it over his shoulder\xe2\x80\x94and I just thought we were two guys hanging out, chatting away, and enjoying the relationship. It wasn\'t like there was a conceptualization here\xe2\x80\x94this was completely off the cuff, spontaneity that we never thought would become an iconic image. \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89 Norman Seeff [9] \n \n   The placeholder cover used for the book uses the  working title ,  iSteve: The Book of Jobs . \n Title [ edit ] \n The book\'s  working title ,  iSteve: The Book of Jobs , was chosen by publisher  Simon & Schuster \'s publicity department. Although author  Walter Isaacson  was "never quite sure about it", his wife and daughter reportedly were. However, they thought it was "too cutesy" and as a result Isaacson persuaded the publisher to change the title to something "simpler and more elegant." [10] \n The title  Steve Jobs  was allegedly chosen to reflect Jobs\'s "minimalist" style and to emphasize the biography\'s authenticity, further differentiating it from unauthorized publications, such as  iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business  by Jeffrey Young. [11] \n \n Chapters [ edit ] \n Many of the chapters within the book have sub-headings, which are matched in various audiobook versions resulting in listings showing 150+ chapters when there are only 42 chapters. The audiobook contains a mistake on one chapter title, listing Chapter 41 as "Round Three, A Never-ending Struggle" instead of "Round Three, Twilight Struggle" as published.\n \n \n \n Chapter No. \n Chapter Title \n Sub-Heading No. \n Sub-Heading Title \n Approx.

The film is directed by  Danny Boyle , produced by  Scott Rudin , and written by  Aaron Sorkin  (with a screenplay adapted both from Isaacson\'s  Steve Jobs  as well as from interviews conducted by Sorkin).\n \n Other media [ edit ] \n Extracts from the biography have been the feature of various magazines, in addition to interviews with the author,  Walter Isaacson . [12] \n To memorialize Jobs\'s life after his death on October 5, 2011,  TIME  published a commemorative issue on October 8, 2011. The issue\'s cover featured a portrait of Jobs, taken by  Norman Seeff , in which he is sitting in the  lotus position  holding the  original Macintosh  computer. The portrait was published in  Rolling Stone  in January 1984 and is featured on the back cover of  Steve Jobs . The issue marked the eighth time Jobs has been featured on the cover of  Time . [13] \nThe issue included a  photographic essay  by Diana Walker, a  retrospective  on  Apple  by  Harry McCracken  and  Lev Grossman , and a six-page essay by  Walter Isaacson . Isaacson\'s essay served as a preview of  Steve Jobs  and described Jobs pitching the book to him. [14] \n Bloomberg Businessweek  also released a commemorative issue of its magazine remembering the life of Jobs. The cover of the magazine features Apple-like simplicity, with a black-and-white, up-close photo of Jobs and his years of birth and death. In tribute to Jobs\'s minimalist style, the issue was published without advertisements. It featured extensive essays by  Steve Jurvetson ,  John Sculley , Sean Wisely, William Gibson, and  Walter Isaacson . Similarly to  Time \'s commemorative issue, Isaacson\'s essay served as a preview of  Steve Jobs .\n Fortune  featured an exclusive extract of the biography on October 24, 2011, focusing on the "friend-enemy" relationship Jobs had with  Bill Gates . [15] \n \n Awards and honors [ edit ] \n Even after a late release that year, the book became Amazon\'s #1 seller for 2011. [16] \n \n 2012  Financial Times  and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award , shortlist [17] \n 2011  The New York Times  bestseller \n 2011  Christian Science Monitor  Best Book, nonfiction \n 2011  Time  Magazine\'s Best Books of the Year \n References [ edit ] \n \n \n ^   Yin, Sara (August 15, 2011).
